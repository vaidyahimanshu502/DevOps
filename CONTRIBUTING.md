## Contributor License Agreement
Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a [Contributor License Agreement](https://forms.gle/nnNZjB7P1YPuEHb69). You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project. 

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it again.


## How to Contribute
We'd love to accept your innovations, enhancements, patches and contributions to this project. There are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

* One of the first things you want to look for is a contributing.md file. We have one here. This file will tell you how the maintainers of the project want to handle contributions and also contains instructions for setting up the project.
* If one does not exist you may find this information in the read.me or [docs](https://docs.digit.org) . If none of that information exists, file an issue and request it.
* If you're unsure what you would like to do, search the issues. All GitHub projects have a * help wanted * label that maintainers can use to assign to issues they would like help on. Some projects add other labels to issues.
* Look at the issues and labels. In this particular project, you may see that there are three issues raised by other contributors too. Some of them have the help wanted label. Maybe this is something that we could work on.
* Once you've found an issue you want to work on for filed one yourself, ask in the comments if there's a way you can help out. If you're new, let the project maintainer know and ask if they can help you get your first pull request into the project.
* It's important that you come up with the basic idea of the solution with the project maintainer before you start working on the solution. You don't want to spend hours working on a feature just to realize the maintainer won't accept it.

Great. You and the project maintainer agree that it's absolutely necessary to have the feature implementation from DIGIT. Now we can start implementing this feature.

### Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.

# Community Guidelines

At [eGov](https://egov.org.in), we recognize and celebrate the creativity and collaboration of open source contributors and the diversity of skills, experiences, cultures, and opinions they bring to the projects and communities they participate in.

Every one of eGov's open source projects and communities are inclusive environments, based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or similar personal characteristic.

We value diverse opinions, but we value respectful behavior more.

## Respectful behavior includes:

 * Being considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
 * Not engaging in demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, sexualized, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
 * Not engaging in unwanted physical contact.
 * Some eGov's open source projects may adopt an explicit project code of conduct, which may have additional detailed expectations for participants. Most of those projects will use our modified Contributor Covenant.

#Resolve peacefully
We do not believe that all conflict is necessarily bad; healthy debate and disagreement often yields positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful.

If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to address the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.

#Reporting problems
Some of our projects may adopt a project-specific code of conduct. In those cases, a eGov employee will be identified as the Project Steward, who will receive and handle reports of code of conduct violations. In the event that a project hasnâ€™t identified a Project Steward, you can report problems by emailing opensource@egov.org.in.

We will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response. We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from the project and project-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of the report and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is taken. The identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report supplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing harassment or threats to anyone's safety, we may take action without notice.
