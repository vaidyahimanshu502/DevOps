### Swagger API Contract

Please refer to the [Swagget API Contract](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upyog/UPYOG/master/core-services/docs/national-dashboard-ingest.yml) for Document Uploader Service (egov-document-uploader) to understand the structure of APIs and to have visualization of all internal APIs.


### Functionalities

1. When national dashboard ingest metrics API is hit, all the data payload lookup keys are first checked against the db to determine whether they already exist or not. The db table currently being used for storing lookup keys is nss-ingest-data. 

2. If the record for a given date and area details is not present, the payload is then flattened and pushed to nss-ingest-keydata topic.

3. National dashboard ingest kafka pipeline consumer listens on nss-ingest-keydata topic and according to the module to which the data belongs to, pushes it to the respective topic defined in the module.index.mapping key.

4. Once the national dashboard ingest kafka pipeline pushes data to the respective topic, a kafka-connector then takes the flattened records from that topic and ingests to ElasticSearch.
