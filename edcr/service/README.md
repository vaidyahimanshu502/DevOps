# Development Control Regulations
  Module used to scrutinize the building plan diagrams which are in the .dxf file format. It will extract data from from dxf file and will validate against ULB rules and will generate the scrutiny report in the PDF format, the scrutiny report contains the rules which are passing and failing.

## User Guide
This section contains steps that are involved in build and deploy the application.

## Setup with auto installer
* Clone the UPYOG repository.
```bash
$ mkdir -p ${HOME}/egovgithub && cd egovgithub
$ git clone  -b master --single-branch  git@github.com:upyog/UPYOG.git
```
* First time setup which will install the stacks, build the source code, and deploys the artifact to Wildfly
```bash
$ cd ${HOME}/egovgithub/UPYOG/edcr/service && make all
```
-----
* To install the prerequisites DCR Service stacks
```bash
$ cd ${HOME}/egovgithub/UPYOG/edcr/service &&  make install
```
* To build the source code base
```bash
$ cd ${HOME}/egovgithub/UPYOG/edcr/service && make build
```
* To deploy the artifact to WILDFLY
```bash
$ cd ${HOME}/egovgithub/UPYOG/edcr/service && make deploy
```

## Manual Setup Instruction

#### Prerequisites

* Install [maven v3.2.x][Maven]
* Install [PostgreSQL v9.6][PostgreSQL]
* Install [Jboss Wildfly v11.x][Wildfly Customized]
* Install [Git 2.8.3][Git]
* Install [JDK 8 update 112 or higher][JDK8 build]
* Install [Postman 8.7.0][Postman]

#### Database Setup
1. Create a database and user in postgres
2. Create the schema's called `state` & `generic`
3. Execute `ALTER ROLE <your_login_role> SET search_path TO state, generic, public;

```
NB: `<username>` user name of the loggedin system, enter the below command in terminal to find the username.
```bash 
$ id -un
```

#### Building Source
1. Clone the UPYOG repository.
```bash
$ mkdir egovgithub
$ cd egovgithub
$ git clone git@github.com:upyog/UPYOG.git
```
2. Change directory back to `<CLONED_REPO_DIR>/egov`

3. Run the following commands, this will cleans, compiles, tests, migrates database and generates ear artifact along with jars and wars appropriately

 ```bash
 mvn clean package -s settings.xml -Ddb.user=<db_username> -Ddb.password=<db_password> -Ddb.driver=org.postgresql.Driver -Ddb.url=<jdbc_url>
 ```

#### Redis Server Setup

By default UPYOG uses embedded redis server (work only in Linux & OSx), to make eGov suit works in Windows OS or if you want to run redis server as standalone then follow the installation steps below.
 
1. Installing redis server on Linux
 
 ```bash
 sudo apt-get install redis-server
 ```
2. Installing redis server on Windows :- There is no official installable available for Windows OS. To install redis on Windows OS, follow the instruction given in https://chocolatey.org/packages/redis-64

3. Once installed, Change directory to `<CLONED_REPO_DIR>/egov/egov-config/src/main/resources/config/` and create a file called `egov-erp-<username>.properties` and enter the following values based on your environment config.

  ```properties
 ## true by default
 redis.enable.embedded=false
 ```
 If required, you can override any default settings available in `/egov/egov-egi/src/main/resources/config/application-config.properties` by overriding the value in `egov-erp-<username>.properties`.

 to control the redis server host and port use the following property values (only required if installed with non default).

 ```properties
 ## Replace <your_redis_server_host> with your redis host, localhost by default
 redis.host.name=<your_redis_server_host>
 ## Replace <your_redis_server_port> with your redis port, 6379 by default
 redis.host.port=<your_redis_server_port>
 ```

#### Deploying Application

##### Configuring JBoss Wildfly

1. Download and unzip the customized JBoss Wildfly Server from [here][Wildfly Customized]. This server contains some additional jars that are required for the ERP.
2. In case properties needs to be overridden, edit the below file (This is only required if `egov-erp-<username>.properties` is not present)

  ```
  <JBOSS_HOME>/modules/system/layers/base/

  org
  └── egov
    └── settings
      └── main
          ├── config
          │   └── egov-erp-override.properties
          └── module.xml
  ```
3. Update settings in `standalone.xml` under `<JBOSS_HOME>/standalone/configuration`
 * Check Datasource setting is in sync with your database details.
  ```
  <connection-url>jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/<YOUR_DB_NAME></connection-url>
  <security>
    <user-name><YOUR_DB_USER_NAME></user-name>
    <password><YOUR_DB_USER_PASSWORD></password
  </security>
  ```
 * Overriding default post request size (Default is 10 MB). Can override using 'max-post-size' attribute in the below location,
  ```
  <server name="default-server">
   <http-listener name="default" socket-binding="http" max-post-size="104857600" redirect-socket="https" enable-http2="true"/>
   <https-listener name="https" max-post-size="104857600"  socket-binding="https" security-realm="ApplicationRealm" enable-http2="true"/>
   <host name="default-host" alias="localhost">
   <location name="/" handler="welcome-content"/>
   <http-invoker security-realm="ApplicationRealm"/>
   </host>
 </server>
  ```
 * Check HTTP port configuration is correct in
  ```
  <socket-binding name="http" port="${jboss.http.port:8080}"/>
  ```
4. Change directory back to `<CLONED_REPO_DIR>/egov/dev-utils/deployment/` and run the below command
  ```
  $  chmod +x deploy.sh
  $ ./deploy.sh
  ```

 Alternatively this can be done manually by following the below steps.

  * Copy the generated exploded ear `<CLONED_REPO_DIR>/egov/egov-ear/target/egov-ear-edcr-<VERSION>.ear` in to your JBoss deployment folder `<JBOSS_HOME>/standalone/deployments`
  * Create or touch a file named `egov-ear-edcr-<VERSION>.ear.dodeploy` to make sure JBoss picks it up for auto deployment

5. Start the wildfly server by executing the below command

  ```
   $ cd <JBOSS_HOME>/bin/
   $ nohup ./standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0 &

  ```
  In Mac OSx, it may also required to specify `-Djboss.modules.system.pkgs=org.jboss.byteman`
  
  `-b 0.0.0.0` only required if application accessed using IP address or  domain name.

6. Monitor the logs and in case of successful deployment, just hit `http://localhost:<YOUR_HTTP_PORT>/edcr/rest/dcr/scrutinize` from your postman.

8. Download postman collection from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upyog/UPYOG/master/edcr/service/egov/egov-edcr/Postman/eDcr%20Collection.postman_collectionv.1.json and import into your local postman and use for testing.

### Setup Multitenancy Locally
1. The state is configured by adding property tenant.{domain_name}=schema_name (state_name) in egov-erp-override.properties.

2. Each new ULB is enabled by adding a schema name and domain name in egov-erp-override.properties file(Available in Wildfly server under ${HOME_DIR}/wildfly-11.0.0.Final/modules/system/layers/base/org/egov/settings/main/config). Schema names should follow a naming standard, It should be the same as that of the city name.

3. Each ULB can be configured by adding an entry like tenant.{domain_name}=schema_name (city_name) in egov-erp-override.properties file. 

5. In the state schema, the state_name passed in the request and city code in the state.eg_table must be the same. Example, In the request tenant id is pg.citya, then in the state schema city table, the city code value should be pg. For other schema this change is not required.

5. Insert data into eg_city, in the city table domain URL value should be the same as configured tenant domain_name in the egov-erp-override.properties.

6. After completing above steps, the local ubuntu machine need to update the domain URLs in the host file which you are going to use for scrutinizing and fetching the plan.

7. Navigate to the root directory and from there open the host config file available in the location 'etc/hosts'. Map the domain URLs with a local IP address in the hosts file and save the changes.

#### Accessing the application using IP address and domain name

* After setup is done APIs one must use state domain URL and in the contract tenantId of concern, the city has to be passed to scrutinize multiple cities.

* One should not use the city domain URL to scrutinize or fetch plan if used that way, the response will be empty.

* The tenantId used should follow {state_name.city_name} naming convention, then the state_name passed in the request and city code in the state schema must be the same, ex, In the request tenant id is pg.citya, then in the state schema city table, the city code value should be pg  .

This section is to be referred only if you want the application to run using any ip address or domain name.

###### 1. To access the application using IP address:
* Have an entry in eg_city table in database with an IP address of the machine where application server is running (for ex: domainurl="172.16.2.164") to access application using IP address.
* Access the application using an url http://172.16.2.164:8080/edcr/rest/dcr/scrutinize where 172.16.2.164 is the IP and 8080 is the port of the machine where application server is running.

###### 2. To access the application using domain name:

* Have an entry in eg_city table in database with domain name (for ex: domainurl= "www.upyogbpa.org") to access application using domain name.
* Add the entry in hosts file of your system with details as 172.16.2.164    www.upyogbpa.org (This needs to be done both in server machine as well as the machines in which the application needs to be accessed since this is not a public domain).
* Access the application  using an url http://www.upyogbpa.org:8080/edcr/rest/dcr/scrutinize where www.upyogbpa.org is the domain name and 8080 is the port of the machine where application server is running.
